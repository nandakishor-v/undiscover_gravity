# undiscover_gravity
Ever studied Physics in school and wondered...what the world would be like if Newton didn't sit under an apple tree? If he didn't discover the effects of gravity that would haunt high schoolers for years to come? This game intends to do just that! Don't let the apple fall on Newton's head and use comic books to keep Newton distracted from his thoughts, so that gravity won't be discovered... So that students can sleep peacefully at night...There won't be any consequences from this at all....right?

Instruction:

❦ Use the A and D of your keyboard to control Newton.

❦ Don't let the apples hit Newton.

❦ Collect comic books to distract Newton.
